#toy-problems

This repository contains two .js files that are used to demonstrate a "toy problem" and an example solution to said problem.

First, review the notes and code in toyProblem.js to understand the "test question."

Then, open bubbleSort.js to see an example of a solution that could work for the "test question/toy problem".

You can execute the JavaScript by opening your browser to any page, opening the developer tools, selecting console, pasting the Javascript into the console and hitting enter.

Keep in mind that if you want to type an additional line in the console without executing, holding shift and hitting enter will move your cursor to the next line.

Feel free to play with either problem or solution to help gain an understanding of object arrays and sorting functions.
