//Example of toy problem (solution in bubbleSort.js)
//We will use an array that contains 3 objects, each with the same fields (title, order and id)

water_categories_data = [
  {
    "title": "river",
    "order": 3,
    "id": "yqM3w",
  },
  {
    "title": "ocean",
    "order": 1,
    "id": "b1en2n",
  },
  {
    "title": "ocean",
    "order": 2,
    "id": "blen2n"
  }
]

//You'll notice the objects are out of order in the "order" array.
//Test: write a function that takes an array of numbers as input.
//It should output an array of those same numbers sorted from lowest to highest.
//e.g., a function that takes [3, 1, 2, 4] and returns [1, 2, 3, 4]
//see bubbleSort.js for solution.
